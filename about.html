      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently a sophomore at Santa Clara High School. I grew up in
        California's Bay Area, in the midst of Silicon Valley, which is bustling
        with technology. I've taken multiple computer science classes inside and
        out of school, and I plan on taking AP computer science classes in the
        future. I'm also currently part of my school's STEM Leadership Institute
        which provides me many unique opportunities.

      <h2>Interest in Computer Science</h2>
      <p>
        I always had an interest in computer science from a young age. Growing
        up, my dad was a software engineer so I was heavily influenced by his
        career, and by hearing from his experience, I decided engineering was
        something I also really wanted to pursue. When I first began coding, I
        was a bit doubtful. It was very intimidating for me. I didn't know how I
        could possibly grasp the concept properly, and I was very doubtful of
        myself. However, as I practiced, I improved a lot, and I really enjoy
        coding whenever I'm doing it. I now continue programming and improving
        my skills, participating in any opportunity I come across.

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        Whenever I have free time, there are plenty of things I enjoy doing a
        lot. I enjoy playing badminton for my school team and going swimming
        often. I do a lot of baking at home, and some of the things I enjoy
        doing most are traveling the world and doing photography.
