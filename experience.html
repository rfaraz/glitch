      <p>
        Since Shelter in Place began, I participated in two online hackathons, Bithacks and Bridgehacks. The theme for Bithacks
        was AI for social impact, and my project for this was Blossom, a time-managing app. The second competition had multiple 
        categories, and my project was focused on augmented reality for environmental impact. My project for this hackathon was 
        Energy Fluent, an energy conservation app. These hackathons were a completely new experience for me, and I didn't expect
        much from them, but to my surprise, both my projects won a prize! Blossom placed 4th in the main category, and Energy Fluent
        won under the AR/VR category. Both of these experiences were really enjoyable, and I will continue participating in hackathons.

    <!--Closing-->
    <p>
      I'm still very early on in my computer science career, and I have so much experience yet to gain. I have many upcoming plans for myself
      from my school's STEM program to applying for internships in technology. I also plan on participating in First Tech Challenge,
      a robotics competition, with my new team. I'm looking forward to all of the exciting new things I will be exploring 
      as I go on.
